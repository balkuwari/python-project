My project will be implementing the popular game Tetris, I chose this game specifically because, i enjoyed playing this game since i was young. 
I will be using couple of libraries including Pigame and Random.

My project will include the following features:
1- Main menu which includes a login, signup, leaderboard, play game buttons.
2- User will be able to view his/her current score. The score will keep increasing while user is able to form a horizontal line of cubes until the cubes reach the the last row.
3- The game will have a single mode, which keeps getting harder while the time is counting.
4- user will be able to see number of current filled lines of cubes.
5- User will be able to record his/her high score while logged in.
6- The game will have a pause and resume button.
7- User will be able to view shadow of the current shape. 
8- User will be able to view the next 3 random shapes.

Description of the user interface: 
The user interface will include a main menu as mentioned in point number 1. The interface during the game will have a pause and resume button that can be controlled using the button P to pause and R to resume. The keyboard arrows will be used to move the shapes. The mouse will be used to navigate from the main menu to play the game it self.
